# Data repository for Lin, Pennycook, & Rand (2022)

Repository URL: https://github.com/hauselin/misinfo-diffusion-model-accuracy-prompt

OSF data/code repository: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3DUCN

If you're planning to run the analysis scripts in the Code directory, I strongly recommend you clone or download this ENTIRE repository.

This repository contains stuff for the following paper: Thinking more or thinking differently? Using drift-diffusion modeling to illuminate why accuracy prompts decrease misinformation sharing (see manuscript [here](https://www.hauselin.com/public/papers/LinPennycookRand2023-thinking.pdf))

Data directories
- `data`: data
- `models`: Bayesian models generated by code in `src` will be saved in this directory
- `src`: scripts/code to run analysis
