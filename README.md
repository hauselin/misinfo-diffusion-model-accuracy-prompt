OSF data/code repository: https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/3DUCN

If you're planning to run the analysis scripts in the Code directory, I strongly recommend you clone or download this ENTIRE repository.

This repository contains stuff for the following paper: Thinking more or thinking differently? Using drift-diffusion modeling to illuminate why accuracy prompts decrease misinformation sharing (see manuscript [here](https://psyarxiv.com/kf8md/))

Data directories
- `data`: data
