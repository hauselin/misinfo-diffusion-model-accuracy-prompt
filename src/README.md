# src

Click `src.Rproj` to open an RStudio session and R project/workspace. Then run the code in `behavior.Rmd` and `ddm_brms.R` from that R session/project to rerun the analyses in the manuscript. `utils.R` contains utility functions. The code reads data from `../data` and saves model outputs to `../models`.
